About Ndu
Ndu runs on the blockchain technology allowing relevant data about drug production, distribution and sales to be immutable and safely stored. Ndu combines the decentralized power of the blockchain to combat and eradicate conterfeit drugs.
The rise in sale of counterfeit drugs in Africa has become an overwhelming problem. In Nigeria alone,
NAFDAC a drug law enforcement agency found in 2002, that nearly 41% of pharmaceuticals were counterfeit, and 70% were unregistered.
Though there have been efforts to combat the presence of counterfeit drugs, the amount of fake drugs sold remains high.
Ndu is a native word in the Igbo Language which means Life.
We hope to save many lives that are being lost daily with this amazing new technology that has been built on the blockchain.

What we've achieved:
Through a ton of research and consultations with the pharmaceutical industry and relevant organisations, we have built a simple demo for a solution which could potentially save millions of lives yearly by simply being able to scan and verify the authenticity of a drug.

How it works
Pharmacies and drug producting companies are licensed by relevant government agencies and then registered on the app.
Once registered, there are given NDU tokens which are used to perform transactions on the application such as registration of drugs.
These registered institutions use the NDU token to registered packets of drugs.
On registered a certain quantity of a drug, for example: 20 packets of Panadal, 20 Serials are generated, one for each packet.
Each serial is turned into a barcode and pasted at the back of these drugs.
Finally, these barcodes can easily be used to get details about the authenticity of a drug as well as it's manufacturers.
Plans for the future
There are limitless opportunities and the sky is the limit for what we are building and we are very commited to bringing this life saving solution to our country Nigeria, which has one of the worst rates of drug counterfeiting and death rates due to ingesting these poisons, in the world.
We only require time, necessary funding and support from enthusiatic people and institutions to bring this life saving solution to life.

How can you help us
Funding! ðŸ˜… - Yes, we have some figures in mind, but we'd like to have private conversations with interested parties about that.
Connecting us to Government agencies, big pharmaceutical corporations and those that can steer us in a better direction.
Tips, advice, anything and everything is appreciated!
How we plan to use funds appropriated to us:
Research, development and a ton of learning to enable us further.
Consultations with relevant authourities in the Pharmaceutical space.
Incentives for the use and adoption of blockchain as an enabler for this solution.
Is there a revenue generation model?
Certainly, registration fees, purchasing of the NDU token, and some other ideas we're messing with, but honestly, right now, we are more interested in getting this up and running and making some impact first. Money comes to those who bring value ðŸ˜‰.

Reach us:
There's so much more to say, but we'll leave it here for now.
I hope you're as excited as we are! ðŸ˜ƒ If you have any questions, comments or interest to support us,
